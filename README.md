# NoiR Binary (NRB) file library

`libnrb` allows for reading and writing files in the NoiR Binary (NRB) format.  These binary files are generated by the Noir music notation compiler.

The specification of the file format is given in `nrb_spec.md`.

The full library is contained in the `nrb.c` and `nrb.h` source files.  Refer to the header for documentation of the API.

The `nrbwalk.c` test program is an example of using the library to parse a NRB file and walk through its contents.

## Releases

### Origins

This library was originally spun off of the NMF parsing modules and the `nmfwalk` program in Noir beta version 0.5.2.  The NRB file format is an update of NMF, so everything about NRB is updated from NMF.

NRB includes version information in the header and a method for future expansion.  Hopefully this will prevent the need for forking the file format again like this.
